# Psych 1322 - Decision-Making Bot
## Introduction
This is a webapp that allows users to interact with a specially fine-tuned OpenAI model to get advice on various decisions using the Maximum Expected Utility model we learned in Psy1322. The webapp is a traditional react app with essentially no backend, and just feeds the user's input into an OpenAI completion model that has been finetuned, and returns that output to the user. 

## Two strategies I used to fine-tune the model: Role-play and Few-Shot Learning
